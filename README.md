# Music-Recommendation-Using-Q-Learning-And-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
This repository compares two methodologies for music recommendation: Q-learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning (Dueling DQN), applied to a dataset of music tracks with features like genre, artist, and danceability. The goal is to build a system that recommends music based on user preferences.
